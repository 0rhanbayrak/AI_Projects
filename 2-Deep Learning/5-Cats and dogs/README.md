Project Description
- The goal of this project is to understand the key differences between building a deep learning model manually and customizing a pre-trained model using transfer learning. 
  By comparing these approaches, we can evaluate their performance, efficiency, and suitability for different applications.
  
  This project specifically focuses on classifying images of cats and dogs using a dataset containing labeled images of both categories.

  The aim is to develop and compare models for effective animal image classification.

Methodology
-Building a Model from Scratch(model1): Instead of training the model from scratch, we present the architecture of a manually designed deep learning model along with a visualization of its results.
-Using Transfer Learning with MobileNet: We fine-tune the pre-trained MobileNet model for the same classification task. The results will also be visualized and analyzed.

Comparison: The performance of both models will be compared using evaluation metrics and visualizations.

Libraries Used
-TensorFlow
-Keras
-Matplotlib
-NumPy

Results & Analysis
Through this project, we obtained results demonstrating that transfer learning is more efficient than training a model from scratch. The key findings include:
-Shorter training time
-Higher accuracy rate
